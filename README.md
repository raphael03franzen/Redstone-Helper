# About
This Plugin is intended to help with Redstone design/building.
<br>
I'm open for Ideas and contribution, but please be patient, as this is my first Plugin.

# ⚙️ Features

## ✔️ Currently implemented:
- **Redstone Barrel**:
  Gives the user a Barrel with items to create a specific Signal Strength.<br>
  e.g. "/barrel 3" gives a Barrel with 4 wooden shovels

## 🔜 Planned:
- **Redstone clock calculator**:
    How many repeaters/comparators for a given frequency
- **Delay Calculator**:
    Minimum delay for a given line length

## 🕰️ Future:
I will try to keep improving this, but this is and always will be just a side project.
